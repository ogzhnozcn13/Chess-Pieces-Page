      piece: 'The King',
      answer:
        'The king may move to any adjoining square. No move may be made such that the king is placed or left in check. The king may participate in castling, which is a move consisting of the king moving two squares toward a same-colored rook on the same rank and the rook moving to the square crossed by the king. Castling may only be performed if the king and rook involved are unmoved, if the king is not in check, if the king would not travel through or into check, and if there are no pieces between the rook and the king.',

      piece: 'The Queen',
      answer:
        'The queen is the strongest of the chess pieces. In practice, a queen, rook, bishop, and knight form a powerful offensive force. Its value is 9 or more (93⁄4 according to chess master Larry Kaufman) pawn units.',

    {
      id: 3,
      piece: 'The Rook',
      answer:
        'The rook may move any number of squares vertically or horizontally without jumping. It also takes part, along with the king, in castling.Although very strong, a rook is slightly weaker than a horse and an elephant combined.',

    {
      id: 4,
      piece: 'The Bishop',
      answer:
        'The bishop may move any number of squares diagonally without jumping. Consequently, a bishop stays on squares of the same color throughout the game. In general, a bishop is worth more than three pawn units (3¼ pawn units according to Larry Kaufman).',

      piece: 'The Knight',
      answer:
        'The horse goes in a two straight cross, symbolically L shape. The most striking feature of the horse is its ability to jump over stones. The starting position is right next to the goals. The knight also gains a lot of power in the middle 4 squares (This applies to all pieces, but more pronounced on the knight).',

    {
      id: 6,
      piece: 'The Pawn',
      answer:
        'Each player has eight pawns at the beginning of the chess. These form a wall in front of other stones. The pawn is the weakest piece in chess, due to its limited range of moves. It cannot move backwards like other stones. However, as the party continues, the importance of the pawns gradually increases as they can reach the last row of the opposite side and turn into a more valuable piece except the king.',
